# Veri-Sonic

A Python project using OpenAI Whisper for audio processing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3.10** installed on your machine. You can check by running:

```bash
python3 --version
```

### Installation

1. **Install Pipenv** (a package manager for Python):
    pip install pipenv

2. **Install project dependencies**:

Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
pipenv install
```

This will automatically install all required packages (like OpenAI Whisper) into an isolated environment.

### Running the Project

To activate the project environment and run Python code:

```bash
pipenv run python your_script.py
```

Or, to enter an interactive shell within the project environment:

```bash
pipenv shell
python your_script.py
```

## Development

If you want to add new Python packages to the project:

```bash
pipenv install package_name
```
